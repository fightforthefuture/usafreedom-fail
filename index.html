            On May 7th, 2015, the Second District Court of Appeals
            ruled that the NSA's bulk collection of phone call data using Section 215 of the Patriot
            Act 
            <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/08/us/nsa-phone-records-collection-ruled-illegal-by-appeals-court.html?_r=0" target="_blank">
            is illegal</a>. This decision, if upheld, would end the NSA's capability
            to suck up bulk phone call data.
            </p> 
            <p>
            Now Congress is trying to pass a bill—
            the USA Freedom Act—that would give this power back to the NSA through
            new legal loopholes, while appearing on the surface to reign-in the NSA.
            The bill is scheduled for a vote in the House of Representatives <a href="http://www.majorityleader.gov/floor/">this week</a>. 
            Don't be fooled. This bill is designed to appease the public while cementing 
            the government's surveillance authority for years to come.

    <h2>This bill will prevent *real* NSA reform.</h2>
    <section>
        <p>
            The USA Freedom Act will prevent the reform we really need &mdash; the expiration
            of the bulk collection provisions of the Patriot Act, Section 215 &mdash;
            which is currently scheduled to take place on June 1.
        </p>
        <p>
            The government has already proven <em class="underline">with the existing law</em>
            that they will exploit every loophole they can find to spy on hundreds of millions
            of people who are suspected of no wrongdoing. On the surface, the USA Freedom Act
            appears to reign mass surveillance in, but it is carefully worded to allow all sorts
            of new spying, while nullifying any privacy benefits it appears to offer.
